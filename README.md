Conor Doherty - Created the github repository. Created the basic java project. Wrote the frontInterface.java file which is the interface for the user to pick a function, enter the search query information and returns data.

Mohamed Difallah - 

Aaron Bruce - I did part 2 of the assignment 
sheet where I had to create a ternary 
search tree to store bus stop names and 
functionality to search for these bus stops. 
I also comitted BusStopSearchTest.java that
provided Conor with the necessary setup for 
creating a ternary search tree and storing 
the bus stops in that tree.


John Cosgrove -  Created tripSearch.java and coded part 3 of the assignment. Then helped Conor integrate it with interface.
